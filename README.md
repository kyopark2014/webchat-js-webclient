## Coversation Overview

This design was inspired from "FilipRastovic" as described in reference.
I appended java script to make a chat service. Also, several compoents were added such as display/delivery notification and presence features. 

This pciture shows a snap shot for group conversation where the call log is left side and chat conversation is right side.

### Structure

The left side shows the call logs and right side shows message logs.
For this calllist and msglist are used with msgHistory which saves all call and message history.

#### Call Log for history of conversation
```java
(function(index, name) {
            list[index].addEventListener("click", function() {
                if(name != callee) {
                    callee = name;

                    callLog = msgHistory.get(callee);                   
                    for(i=callLog.length-1;i>=0;i--) {
                        if(callLog[i].logType==0) {  // receive
                            if(callLog[i].status==1) { // If display notification needs to send
                                sendDisplayNoti(callLog[i].msg);
                                callLog[i].status = 2;
                            }
                            else break;
                        }
                    }

                    if(closedGroup.get(callee) == 1) {
                        console.log(callee+' was closed previously');
                        setConveration(name);
                    } 
                    else {
                        setConveration(name);
                    }

                    updateChatWindow(name); 
                } 
            })
        })(listIDX.get(from),from);
```

#### Message Log for history of chatting
```java
(function(index) {
        msglist[index].addEventListener("click", function() {
            callLog = msgHistory.get(callee);
            if(callLog.length < maxMsgItems) i = index;
            else i = index + maxMsgItems;
        })
    })(i);
```

#### Call Log

Call Log shws the name of participants in chat room and the last message and received time.

#### Chat Profile

Chat Profile shows the name and numbers of participants in the groupchat. Also, there are three buttons, refresh, add new member and left groupchat.

The profile from participants is loaded from profile server which is based on REST API.

```java
// load all profiles 
function loadProfiles() {
    console.log("Get all profiles");
    var xmlHttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xmlHttp.open( 'GET', 'http://'+host+':4040/getall', false );      
    xmlHttp.send( null );
    
    const jsonObject = JSON.parse(xmlHttp.responseText)
    
    members = new HashMap();
    memberSize = jsonObject.length;
    
    for(i=0;i<jsonObject.length;i++) {
        const profile = JSON.parse(jsonObject[i]);
    
        members.put(profile.UID, profile.Name);
    }

    return members
}
```

In order to sharing profiles, the user also needs to upload the profile as bellow.

```java
function SetProfile(id, name) {
    var xmlHttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xmlHttp.open( 'POST', 'http://'+host+':4040/add', false ); // false for synchronous request      

    const profile = {
        UID: id,
        Name: name
    }
    
    const profileJSON = JSON.stringify(profile);
    console.log(profileJSON);

    xmlHttp.send(profileJSON);
    
    console.log(xmlHttp.responseText);
}
```



#### Chat Bubble (Receive)
The received message needs to show the sender name and the sent time where the time is based on sent time which is reached in the server.

#### Chat Bubble (Send)
The sent message bubble can shows how many members in the groupchat read the message but the sender name doesn't need to display.

#### Display notification

If one of participants receives the message, then there is a read notification icon in the left of chat bubble.

#### Message-id

Message id is an unique identification for message history. It is generated by the client.

```java
function uuidv4() {
    return ([1e7]+-1e3+-4e3+-8e3+-1e11).replace(/[018]/g, c =>
      (c ^ crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(1))[0] & 15 >> c / 4).toString(16)
    );
}
```

#### Event Structure

In order to simple management of message and notification, the body of event should use for message and notification which have different structure.

For groupchat, "Originated" is used to identify the sender since the sender is also a particiant in group participant. So, "From" is always the id of groupchat.

```java
const chatmsg = {
            EvtType: "message",
            From: From,
            Originated: Originaterd,
            To: callee,
            MsgID: uuidv4(),
            Timestamp: timestamp,
            Body: message.value
        };
```

The body of notification is required to marsharing as bellow. This code shows the notification for "create" in a groupchat.

```c
const chatmsg = {
            EvtType: 'create',
            From: grpID,
            Originated: uid,
            To: grpID,
            MsgID: '',
            Timestamp: timestamp,
            Body: JSON.stringify(participantList)
        };
```
